### **1. Value-judgement**
Usually value judgement when modifies epistemic or abstract nouns – e.g. *deeper understanding, deeper insight(s), deeper knowledge, deeper appreciation, deeper analysis, deeper investigation, deeper exploration, deeper examination, deeper grounding, deeper comprehension, deeper questions*.

Not a value judgement (literal / technical): *deeper layers, deeper tissue(s), deeper penetration, deeper brain, deeper regions, deeper structures, deeper neurons, deeper cortex, deeper tumors, deeper skin, deeper laminae, deeper crypts, deeper sleep*.

- *This work will provide a **deeper** understanding of the dynamic regulation of A-to-I RNA editing in different neuronal cell types and shed light on the role of RNA editing in brain function.*

### **3a. Gratuitous**
Often gratuitous when modifying epistemic or abstract nouns – e.g. *deeper understanding, deeper insight(s), deeper knowledge, deeper appreciation*.

### **3b. Amplified**
Sometimes amplified – e.g. *much, even, far, significantly, progress, considerably*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These results have prompted us to perform a much **deeper** investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time.*

### **3c. Broader context**
Often stacked
