### **1. Value-judgement**
Usually yes - evaluates quantity, scope, or scale as a virtue (≈ very large, extensive, far-reaching). Most often modifies abstract or collective nouns; magnitude is impressionistic rather than measured, e.g.: *majority, array, number, amount, resources, potential, diversity, literature, body, range, repertoire, network, expertise, data, knowledge, implications*.

Can usually be removed or replaced (*large, many*) with little change to the core propositional meaning.

- *Apart from the basic elements of the methyltransferase and polymerase enzymatic activities, such as substrate binding and active site residues, little to nothing is known about the sequence determinants that contribute to this **vast** array of activities.*

### **2. Hyperbolic**
Hyperbolic when modifying abstract head nouns (*vast knowledge, vast gap, vast potential*); also hyperbolic when modifying quantifier nouns (*range, number* etc.).

Exception: **vast majority** is so common that it should not be considered hyperbolic.

- *Relative to how much is known regarding the producing of diagnosis, there is a **vast** gap in the knowledge about how to inform parents of those diagnoses.*

### **3a. Gratuitous**
Often gratuitous when **vast** modifies abstract or non-quantified nouns where size is not specified (e.g. *vast knowledge, vast literature, vast potential, vast experience, vast implications*).

- *However, this **vast** literature has been based, amongst without exception, on experimenter-administered drug.*

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *With the emergence of the Human Genome Project, the amount of mapping data is rapidly becoming so **vast** that development of facilities for online continual updating is rapidly becoming so **vast** that development of facilities for online continual updating of a permanent human gene mapping database are considered to be the highest priority in the organisation of these meetings.*

### **3c. Broader context**
Sometimes stacked

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This Project will test two potentially disruptive ideas: i) the concept that the full effects of cell or EV therapy require repeated doses would constitute a major paradigm shift, with potentially **vast** implications for the entire field of reparative medicine; ii) the concept that the effects of cell therapy can be reproduced with cell-free administration of EVs would revolutionize the field.*
