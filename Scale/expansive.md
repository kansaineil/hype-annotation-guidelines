### **1. Value-judgement**
Usually yes. **Expansive** evaluates size, scope, or reach as a virtue (≈ broad, wide-ranging, extensive), rather than stating a necessary technical property.

Not a value judgement when it describes a literal physical or biological process with measurable extent or force (e.g. *expansive growth, expansive pressure, expansive remodeling*).

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Our initial efforts have been broad in scope incorporating the expertise of engineers, biologists and clinicians from an **expansive** range of clinical and academic areas.*

- *In tissues such as the breast, these cells undergo **expansive** growth and differentiation with every pregnancy.*

### **3b. Amplified**
Rare

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *While current functional neuroimaging methods with fluorodopa positron-emission tomography (F-Dopa-PET) or beta-CIT single photon emission computer tomography (Beta-CIT-SPECT) show relatively high sensitivity and specificity in assessing nigrostriatal function even before PD patients become symptomatic, they are very **expansive**, meaning that they are not currently appropriate for routine diagnostic screening.*
