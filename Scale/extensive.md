Usually yes. **Extensive** treats size, amount, or scope as a positive attribute – e.g. *experience, research, expertise, training, knowledge, background, program, collaboration, record, involvement*.

Not a value judgement when refers to a measurable physical, biological, or clinical extent (*damage, spread, loss, proliferation, exposure*).
