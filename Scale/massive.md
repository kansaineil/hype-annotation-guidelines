title: Massive
parent: Scale
---

### **1. Value-judgement**
Usually yes. Evaluates magnitude as extreme or exceptional. Most often with abstract or collective nouns (*impact, loss, expansion, increase, burden, effort, project*).

Non–value judgement when part of a fixed technical or clinical expression – e.g. *massive hemorrhage / massive bleeding, massive transfusion, massive apoptosis / necrosis, massive proteinuria, massive infiltration / inflammation, massive burns*.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The **massive** scale of these observations will reveal the most comprehensive and unbiased global view of the persistence cellular state, to date.*

- *While 25% of patients admitted to level 1 trauma centers receive at least one unit of RBCs, those receiving **massive** transfusion (MT), defined as 10 or more units within 24 hours, consume 71% of all RBC transfusions with a 40% risk of in-hospital mortality.* (Non-value judgement)

### **2. Hyperbolic**
Yes when modifies abstract head nouns directly (e.g. *massive impact, massive effort, massive project, massive loss*).

Also yes when modifies quantity or container nouns (e.g. *massive amounts, massive numbers, massive quantities*).

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The results include **massive** amounts of information about genes, proteins, and metabolites in an experimental system, which represents a revolutionary technological advancement in biomedical research that also necessitates new tools to sort and analyze the information.*

### **3a. Gratuitous**
Often yes

- *However, it is unclear why the motivational system fails to drive patients to compensate for this **massive** weight loss with increased food intake and preference for palatable, calorie-dense foods - the normal homeostatic response.*

### **3b. Amplified**
Rare

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very **massive** reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.*

### **3c. Broader context**
Possible

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Parallel to the outstanding NCRR and overall NIH support to Scripps, the Scripps Health system has provided a **massive**, unprecedented investment that fully certifies its priority and willingness to take on risk to promote heightened academic transformation.*

### **3d. Grounds**
Possible

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Existing carts are **massive** (50-100 kg) which precludes their transport in automobiles, taxis and in luggage racks of bus, train and aircraft.*
