### **1. Value-judgement**
Value judgement when **considerable** modifies abstract or evaluative nouns, where magnitude is framed as impact, importance, or merit (e.g. *considerable progress, interest, effort, promise, importance, potential, impact*).

Not a value judgement when it modifies quantifying nouns, where amount or degree is the informational point (e.g. *considerable amount, number, proportion, time, variability*).

### **3a. Gratuitous**
Often gratuitous when modifying nouns that already encode evaluation, effort, or importance without a clear threshold, e.g.: *considerable evidence, progress, interest, effort, expertise, promise, importance, potential, insight, information, impact, value, concern, relevance*. Adds emphasis rather than new information.
