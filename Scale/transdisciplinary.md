### **1. Value-judgement**
Usually yes. Commonly function as a prestige buzzwords signalling breadth/modernity (“good because broad”).

Treat as non-value when the term is necessary for meaning and structure of the sentence (i.e. gratuity test).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The overall goal of the Occupational and Immunologic Lung Disease SCOR Program at the University of Iowa is to perform coordinated **interdisciplinary** research aimed at elucidating the basic mechanisms responsible for the development of these disorders.* (value judgement)

- *This goal will be approached by pursuing a cohesive, **interdisciplinary** program of investigation focused upon early detection of acute lung injury, definition of the biochemical and cellular mechanisms which induce and modulate the injury and development of methods for intervention.* (value judgement)

- *The project will take an **interdisciplinary** approach that uses engineering methods to measure and manipulate ECM materials properties and topology in culture and in vivo, together with molecular cell biology methods and genetic mouse models to investigate whether collagen remodeling and cross-linking promote tumor progression by stiffening the breast tissue to enhance integrin and GFR signaling and / or compromising PTEN expression / function.* (non-value judgement)

### **3b. Amplified**
Often amplified – e.g. *hight, truly, strongly*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This highly **interdisciplinary** project is dedicated to the theoretical study and practical feasibility of biomedical applications of recently developed statistical decision procedures that operate on data known to be dominated by quantum-mechanical noise.*

### **3c. Broader context**
Often

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This symposium will leverage the breadth of expertise of a truly **international** and **multidisciplinary** group of researchers and physicians, who work in the area of functional neuroimaging and related fields, to identify and explore translational research opportunities that may advance clinical diagnostics and drug development and to establish and foster communication, collaboration, and fellowship among the group.*

### **3d. Grounds**
Treat as grounds if evidence given

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The proposed CC staff have extensive experience in cooperative multi-site studies which the Institu been conducting for over eighteen years and includes a strong **interdisciplinary** team of biostatisticia psychologist, an epidemiologist, computer systems analysts, a health educator, and a data coordinator.*
