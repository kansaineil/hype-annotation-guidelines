### **1. Value-judgement**
Value judgement when it modifies abstract or non-quantifiable nouns (e.g. *risk, challenge, problem, barrier, impact*). Here **biggest** means most important / most serious, not literally largest.

**Biggest** = not a value judgement when it refers to literal size, count, or magnitude and can be replaced by *largest* (e.g. *genome, tumor size, weight, rate*).

- *In particular, adherence to a regular eating schedule (e.g. eating three meals and one-two snacks per day and not going more than four waking hours without eating) is one of the **biggest** predictors of treatment success in both BN and BED.* (non-value judgement)
