title: Overwhelming
parent: Scale
---

### **1. Value-judgement**
Yes - evaluates magnitude/strength as extreme (“too much to resist/handle/ignore”). Common with abstract or collective nouns (e.g. *evidence, need, burden, support, majority, number, amount, data, importance, complexity, impact*).

No – when it literally means being “overwhelmed”.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *There is now **overwhelming** evidence that Ty mRNA is reverse transcribed by a Ty-encoded enzyme, probably in a cytoplasmic virus-like particle.*

- *Monocyte production of colony-stimulating factor (CSF), a factor necessary for the proliferation and maturation of granulocyte precursors, is depressed, serum levels of CSF are low, and granulocyte stem cells grown in soft agar culture (CFU-C) are reduced in burned patients who ultimately develop **overwhelming** sepsis and die.* (non-value judgement)
