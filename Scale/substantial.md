### **1. Value-judgement**
Value judgement when **substantial** modifies abstract or collective nouns, where magnitude is framed as merit or impact (e.g. *substantial progress, impact, contribution, benefit, need*).

Not a value judgement when it modifies quantifying nouns (e.g. *substantial number, proportion, percentage, amount*).
