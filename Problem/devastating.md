## **Devastating — annotation guidance**

Adjective: **devastating**  
Category: **Problem**

---

### **1. Value-judgement**  
Almost always yes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Thus, studies that identify and define novel targets for inhibiting tumor growth could lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic agents for prevention of this **devastating** disease.*

</details>

---

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Yes – inherently hyperbolic.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The normal evolution of localized virus-specific antibody production and its role in the pathogenesis of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in recovery from this **devastating** disease remains poorly understood.*

</details>

---

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous. Common head nouns: *disease, disorder, illness, condition, cancer, syndrome, malignancy, infection, epidemic, pandemic, complication, consequence, effect, impact, outcome, problem, burden, morbidity, disability, injury, loss, symptoms, toll, birth, childhood, event, cause, nature.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The principal goals are specifically to understand the neural interactions through which these high-level spatial computations are carried out, and more generally, to provide a conceptual and empirical framework for understanding the **devastating** consequences of damage or dysfunction in these structures in the human brain.* (gratuitous)

- *The long-term goal of this study is to reduce the occurrence of this **devastating** disease by better understanding its causes.* (gratuitous)

- *The data obtained should provide further insight into in vivo glucose metabolism which may lead towards better treatment strategies of these common but **devastating** disease processes.* (gratuitous – “devastating” can be deleted)

- *Degenerative neurological diseases are responsible for many **devastating** human illnesses.* (non-gratuitous, as it provides defining information)

</details>

---

### **3b. Amplified**  
May be amplified.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Mental retardation and abnormal central nervous system development are among the most **devastating** consequences of the fetal alcohol syndrome.*

</details>

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Very possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *While clearly essential for all eukaryotic cells, nowhere is this process more crucial than in neurons, where intracellular transport deficiencies can underlie **devastating** neurodegenerative conditions.*

</details>

---

### **3d. Grounds**  
May be given.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It is estimated that physical violence may occur in one half of all American marriages, with often **devastating** consequences, including murder, suicide, psychological difficulties, and physical injuries.*

</details>

---

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
May be hedged (e.g. *potentially*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Despite the prevalence of this potentially **devastating** problem, well controlled studies of persistent pain in older adults that utilize a comprehensive multidisciplinary model of outcome to assess treatment efficacy are lacking.*

</details>
