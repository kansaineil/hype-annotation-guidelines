### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Used predominantly as a predicate and, as such, often cannot be deleted.

Commonly directly modified nouns: *goal, mechanism, target, nature, problem, question, population, role*.

Ask whether *elusive* can be deleted and the meaning remains (relatively) unchanged.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *However, the role of the antigen-presenting cell (APC) that initiates this CD8 T cell response remains **elusive**.* (gratuitous)

- *After 30 years of research, the pathogenesis of experimental allergic orchitis (EAO), an autoimmune disease of the testis, remains **elusive**.* (non-gratuitous)

- *The basis for the **elusive** mechanism of differential editing during the life cycle will be explored by quantifying edited RNA levels and assessing the relationship between differential gRNA gene content and gRNA sequences in differential editing.* (gratuitous)

- *The **elusive** nature of the natural reservoir makes eradication of the agent impossible and elevates the control of this virus and bioterrorist threat through vaccination or therapeutic means to a level of paramount importance.* (gratuitous)

### **3c. Broader context**  
Sometimes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>
