## **Unmet — annotation guidance**

Adjective: **unmet**  
Category: **Problem**

---

### **1. Value-judgement**  
Yes, usually weakly evaluative: signals absence and elevates it to a problem.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *There is substantial **unmet** need for effective cancer control programs in this underserved population, and preliminary evidence suggests tailoring may be especially effective among African Americans and those with low income.*

</details>

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
No.

NA

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Usually gratuitous in attributive constructions. Head nouns typically encode the meaning of “unmet” (e.g. *need, challenge, goal, demand, opportunity, problem, expectation, requirement, priority, gap*).  
As predicate, may be non-gratuitous or gratuitous – ask whether it can be deleted.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The current study will fill an **unmet** need for research through an innovative approach to the analysis of cesarean section use.* (gratuitous)

- *However, knowledge about how sensory input drives synaptic remodeling is still **unmet**.* (non-gratuitous; note that this is odd wording)
