### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Possibly gratuitous, but less common than some other problem adjectives.

Common head nouns: *prognosis, outcome, survival, disease, statistic, outlook, sensitivity, picture, result, chance, diagnosis, rate, recruitment, response, treatment, control, data, failure, figure, quality, record, compliance, enrollment*.

Note that most of these nouns do not inherently encode negative evaluation (e.g. *good prognosis, improved survival, high-quality data*).  
(Exception: *failure*.)

Consider whether *dismal* adds necessary information or merely intensifies.

- *Factors explaining these **dismal** numbers are: Hispanic students are more likely to be first in their family to start college; and students who “stop out”.* (gratuitous)

- *A major reason for the **dismal** prognosis with SCCL is that this tumor metastasizes early and widely.* (non-gratuitous)

Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

### **3d. Grounds**  
May be given – e.g. data.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The current standard of care has a **dismal** sensitivity (only 53% using octant systematic biopsy in a cohort of radical prostatectomy specimens with previously diagnosed, clinically significant disease [5]), mainly because the sampling grid only randomly intersects the pathologic tissues.*
