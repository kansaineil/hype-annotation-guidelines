### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when used in attributive structure. Commonly modifies:  
*rate, increase, rise, trend, number, statistic, level, spread, pace, proportion, situation, fact, epidemic, frequency, prevalence, prospect, reality, shortage, concern, data, emergence, lack, surge, development, issue, paucity, percentage, possibility, scenario, decrease, finding, gap, growth, mortality, problem, prognosis, speed.*

Note on nouns: the whole phrase (e.g. *at an alarming rate*) may be considered gratuitous if the verb already encodes the proposition.  
When used as predicate, probably not gratuitous.
