### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes when it suggests “state-of-the-art and therefore desirable”. Typical nouns:  
*research, technology, methods, treatments, findings, information, tools, discoveries*  

No when used purely to indicate time or sequence, without praise. Typical nouns:  
*version, report, release, update, news, year, time, cycle, series, record, dataset, sample, batch*  

When not clear whether it signals praise, look at the broader context.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *As in previous such meetings , the Congress has two principal purposes : ( 1 ) to provide avenue at which the **latest** research results and significant findings can be revealed and discussed ; and ( 2 ) to provide an overview of the progress being achieved by the international community of immunologists , in a manner that we be comprehensible to the professional immunologist , regardless of sub-specialty .* (value judgement)

- *The Keystone Symposia meeting on Angiogenesis : Advances in Basic Science and Therapeutic Applications will critically examine the **latest** basic science on the regulation of angiogenesis in health and disease ; discuss the lessons from clinical trials in cancer and intraocular neovascular disorders ; and identify novel therapeutic targets .* (value judgement)

- *The **latest** generation of DNA sequencing technology has spurred a tremendous increase in the use of sequencing to answer fundamental questions in biology and medicine .* (value judgement — broader context)

- *The Arcturus AutoPix , the **latest** generation LCM , is a self-contained system for acquisition of specific tissues or cells from frozen sections for genomic and / or proteomic studies .* (non-value judgement)

- *The **latest** version ( STDBII , 4.5 ) also contains kinetic data on spin trapping rates as well as a new parameter , the NoH value ( the ratio of aN / aH ) , which has proved useful for the identification of DMPO adducts .* (non-value judgement)

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous. Can it be deleted, and, with only minimal local repair, the meaning remains largely unchanged.  
Particularly common, but not limited to, use in attributive constructions where the noun already implies “new knowledge/progress” (e.g., *discoveries, developments, advances, progress, breakthroughs*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Hence , the major goal of this meeting is to provide a cohesive forum for presenting , evaluating and discussing the **latest** approaches to understanding the effects of pollutants on cardiovascular health .* (gratuitous)

- *The goal of the meeting is to present the **latest** available pharmaceutical data on pulmonary protein delivery and safety , side by side with the state-of-the-art in pulmonary immunology as it relates to tolerance and reaction to exogenous protein exposure .* (gratuitous)

- *The objective of the meeting is to discuss the **latest** basic science finding and review the status of the clinical applications of angiogenic growth factors and inhibitors ; learn the **latest** molecular and genetic findings on the regulation of angiogenesis ; discuss the results of clinical trials in angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis ; and identify the pathological conditions that are most likely to benefit and such treatments .* (gratuitous)

- *Here we propose to further develop the docking methodology by incorporating recent density matching algorithms , the **latest** achievements in small molecule docking , as well as by finding an efficient way to deal with both side-chain and backbone flexibility .* (non-gratuitous)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes (e.g., *very*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Our 18 TG faculty are all NIH funded ( some 47 NIH funding components amongst them as PI status ) , 165 collaborative papers published together , and they are employing the very **latest** technologies and approaches with outstanding core support .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Resource personnel promote excellence in cancer research by incorporating the **latest** innovative technologies and instrumentation and by giving personalized advisement on best practices for sample preparation , probe selection and quantitative measures .*  

- *For example , activatable drugs can be injected in a vein or artery , then deployed directly in the tumor with needles or catheters using medical GPS , a technique that enables the physician to navigate through the body with real-time visualization using the **latest** advanced imaging technologies , such as magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , computed tomography ( CT ) , cone beam CT ( CBCT ) , or ultrasound .*
