### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

**Note:** Skip instances where a verb has been mistagged as an adjective (e.g., *new evidence is emerging*).

- **Yes** — when it implies:  
  (1) newness and future importance (e.g., *field; area; research; concept; paradigm; discipline*)  
  (2) increasing risk or concern (e.g., *threat; crisis; concern; challenge*)  
  (3) expanding recognition (e.g., *evidence; understanding; knowledge; literature; consensus; view; picture*)

- **No** — when purely temporal with no implication of importance (rare), e.g., *emerging infectious diseases; emerging strains; emerging cell populations; emerging responses during development*.  
  If unsure, check broader sentential context for promotional force.

- *The endocrine-like action of purines is an **emerging** field of investigation , and virtually no information was available until the above studies , which indicated that purines modulate endocrine-dependent responses in the ovary .* (value-judgement)

- *The **emerging** antibiotic resistance of current pathogens , the discovery of new disease agents , and the specter of bioterrorism have made clear the necessity of increased fundamental scientific investigation into all aspects of infectious diseases .* (non-value judgement — temporal)

- *The second is a unique and powerful **emerging** mouse population called the Collaborative Cross ( CC ) , whose development and use has been funded by several diverse NIH institutes .* (value-judgement)
