### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes when it suggests “new and therefore desirable”. Typical nouns related to (1) methods/technologies and (2) knowledge/ideas:  
*approach, method, technique, methodology, strategy, protocol, procedure, platform, technology, tool, device, framework, model, hypothesis, concept, paradigm, theory, insight, understanding, discovery, finding, evidence*  

Usually no when it mainly means “newly identified / newly developed” and is applied to a biomedical entity/intervention. Typical nouns:  
*gene, protein, receptor, ligand, enzyme, kinase, cytokine, peptide, isoform, mutation, variant, RNA, DNA, biomarker, antibody, antigen, virus, compound, agent, inhibitor, drug, vaccine, therapy, treatment, intervention, formulation, regimen, mechanism, pathway, signaling*  

In very broad terms, the more abstract the target is, the more likely *novel* is to imply a value judgement.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We propose to resolve these conflicts with a **novel** approach that directly combines anatomical pathway tracing ( Aim # 1 ) and physiological receptive field mapping ( Aim # 2 ) to define areas .* (value judgement – knowledge & possible treatment)

- *First , side population ( SP ) stem cells appear to differentiate into cardiomyocytes in our mouse infarction model , but mitoses in these immature cardiomyocytes are only noted in the transgenic mice , thus possibly uncovering a **novel** mechanism to induce hyperproliferative progenitor cells .* (value judgement – knowledge & ‘newness’ / ‘surprise’)

- *This application provides a **novel** and comprehensive mechanism to address these needs through research and education .* (value judgement)

- *The main objective of this research is to design **novel** target-oriented antifolates based on biochemical and mechanistic rationales derived from structural and functional information and to study their effects at the cellular and molecular level .* (non-value judgement)

- *Under Aim 1 , we will evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a **novel** vaccine platform and antigen design in animal models for developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine .* (value judgement – technology)

- *Therefore , there continues to be an urgent need to generate both **novel** vaccine and therapeutic strategies against IAV to prevent and combat large scale outbreaks .* (value judgement – method/approach)

- *Here we propose to characterize this **novel** prophylactic stroke therapy and demonstrate the efficacy and immune cell activation in the setting of stroke .* (non-value judgement)

- *We have developed a **novel** assay to measure absolute concentrations of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in tissue culture cells .* (non-value judgement)

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Usually yes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Strategene has developed a **novel** cloning technology which allows this step to be reduced to a simple circularization without the selectable marker .* (gratuitous)

- *This led us to the **novel** hypothesis that spatial acuity of touch can be sharpened by simultaneous application of thermal and mechanical energy .* (gratuitous)

- *The work is **novel** because alpha-2 AR localization in epidermal nerve fibers has not been characterized previously , AR-OR colocalization has not yet been studied and the functional consequences of activation or co-activation are unknown .* (non-gratuitous)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Not uncommon (e.g., *highly, completely, entirely, fundamentally, truly, totally, radically*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These studies are highly **novel** and could help to define new strategies not only for the treatment of hypertension but its prevention as well .*

</details>

### **3c. Broader context**  
Common.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Finally , experiments like those proposed in this application are essential for our understanding of the role of CMV GPCRs in viral pathogenesis and will open **novel** avenues of research for the development of unique antivirals that specifically target the latent reservoir of virus infection .*

</details>

---

### **3d. Grounds**  
Not uncommon.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This proposal is unique and **novel** because it will elucidate the role of a newly discovered chemokine , macrophage inflammatory protein-2 ( MIP2 ) on the induction of alcohol-associated liver injury .*  

- *The proposal thus presents a **novel** approach to study the mechanism of the cellular toxicity of guanine depleting agents , that takes into account the possible compartmentation of guanine nucleotides ( mono-, di- and tri-phosphates ) into general cellular pools and functional pools for specific purposes .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Not uncommon.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We also develop a relatively **novel** line of research in which eye-movements to visual objects are monitored as people follow spoken instructions to manipulate the objects .*  

- *The combination of a rising tide of resistance and the lack of **novel** approaches to the problem makes for a particularly dire situation .*  

- *The present study may provide **novel** information on age- and estrogen-related effects on cervical- and vaginal-cell function .*  

- *Our data also suggest a potentially **novel** role for angiotensin II to exacerbate HOCl-mediated oxidative stress in the blood vessel wall .*
