### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- **Yes** — when used as a priority claim (“the first to …”, “first evidence-based …”), e.g. *evidence; study; demonstration*.  
- **No** — when used as a numbering device (time/sequence/ordering), e.g. *aim; step; phase*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This is the **first** demonstration of the effectiveness of a genetically engineered vaccine to prevent the establishment of a latent HSV infection .*  

- *In this application , we propose to conduct the **first** epidemiological study of the association between HPV methylation status and cervical cancer risk .*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
No — not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Context dependent.  
Can it be removed with only local repair and meaning remains largely intact — see examples.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This will also be the **first** study to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAD in the US elderly population and its impact upon cognitive impairment .*  
  (gratuitous → *This study will also determine the prevalence …*; local repair and meaning remains intact)

- *This will be the **first** study to combine longitudinal neurocognitive testing and brain imaging to better understand the extent and locus of brain changes in AMD .*  
  (gratuitous → *This study combines …*; minimal local repair)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Possible, but rare — e.g. *very*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The results of these experiments will allow us to construct , for the very **first** time , a comprehensive model of the visual analysis of human movement .*  

- *We conducted the very **first** human trial for patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) who are homozygous for the most common CF mutation , the F508 mutation .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We propose the **first** study to examine how tDCS-augmented cognitive training affects cognition and its related brain circuitry in alcohol use disorder in Veterans , which will provide critical information to guide future research and treatment development .*  

- *Our study will be the **first** comprehensive study of racial differences in mtDNAcn , mitochondrial-derived peptide expression and levels , and their effect on PC .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Rare.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

NA

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Key diagnostic for **first**: is the priority claim hedged.  
Expressions of intent (e.g. *we propose to conduct the first study*) are categorised as hedging.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The interactions among these cell surface antigens are very central to immune regulation and will likely form the **first** paradigm for understanding adhesion molecule interactions .* (hedged — *likely*)

- *To our knowledge , these will be the **first** studies of the gamma interferon receptor on macrophages .* (hedged)
