### **1. Value-judgement**  

**Note:** Because unique is highly contextually diverse, annotating based only on the semantics of the target is difficult.

**Usually, yes.**
Unique usually implies “distinctive and therefore noteworthy/advantageous”, especially with abstract or promotional targets (e.g. approach, ability, opportunity, resource, dataset, insight, discovery, program, environment).

**Sometimes, no.**
When used contrastively or definitionaly to mean “specific to” - usually in preduicative construction  (e.g. X is unique to Y).

If unsure, apply the gratuitous test (3a).
If still unclear, check context (3c) for other promotional signals.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The results of this study will provide rare and **unique** information about the pre-migration experiences of emigrants , provide rigorous a test of secular trends versus acculturation , evaluate a novel conceptual framework , and provide valuable information from which to develop prevention efforts to reduce the burden of obesity and related conditions among an important immigrant population .* (value judgement [& gratuitous])

- *In an effort to develop a **unique** approach to this problem area , we have recently established a murine lung adenoma model in our laboratory -- induced by transplacental exposure to N ,ethylnitrosourea .*  (value judgement [& gratuitous]

- *We have the **unique** ability to critically evaluate hypotheses concerning oxygen and control of microvascular function by the use of state of the art techniques such as intravital videomicroscopy , in situ microvessel perfusion , preparation of parenchyma free arterioles and measurement of PO2 with oxygen microelectrodes .* (value judgement [& gratuitous])

-  *The put operon has a **unique** control mechanism that seems to be mediated by the putA gene product , proline oxidase .* (borderline - value judgement [& gratuitous])

- *Kidney has a **unique** ability of accumulating trimethyllysine .* (non-value judgement [borderline - non-gratuitous - other organs do not have this ability])

- *The LLC - PK1 cell line is **unique** in its ability to actively transport sugar .*  (non-value judgement [non-gratuitous - other cell lines do not have this ability; some repair necessary])

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often, yes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Most important , this study will provide **unique** information on the expression of diabetes susceptibility genes in the general population and possibly suggest genetic explanations for the excess prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity in African Americans .*  

- *The training cohort will work with this **unique** , rich data set under the guidance of Dr. Brody , the Center Director , with methodological and substantive support from P50 scientists and statisticians .* (gratuitous)

- *To approach this important question , we will use a **unique** tool , the hydrophobic surfactant , Pluronic L-81 ( L - 81 ) .* (gratuitous → minimal repair – deletion of “a **unique** tool , the”)

- *For NADH peroxidase , we propose to examine the chemical mechanism of peroxide cleavage , and investigate a **unique** , non-redox role for the bound cofactor , FAD .* (gratuitous)

- *We enrolled a dedicated and **unique** cohort of SuperAgers and Controls committed to longitudinal assessment and brain donation at death .* (gratuitous)

- *The fact that the kidney receives 25 percent of the cardiac output and has specialized concentrating and transporting abilities makes it **unique** in its susceptibility to chemical - induced toxicity .* (non-gratuitous)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Possible. Typical modifiers: *very, truly, highly, especially*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These patients suffer **very unique** disabilities in the area of speaking and eating , impairments which may significantly compromise their quality of life .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Common.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *For 1982 through 1985 , he is the chairman of the Educational Planning Committee ( the curriculum committee ) and is in a strong and **unique** position to influence curricular change .*  

- *Furthermore , from a biophysical standpoint , the pilus assembly apparatus represents a remarkable and **unique** molecular motor .*  

- *NM- INBRE 's effective organizational structure and institutional cooperation with recognition of each partner 's important and **unique** roles builds upon its scientific achievements , effective integration of training and research using bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing technologies , connect new investigators with established mentors and collaborators , and contribute to developing New Mexico 's biomedical research workforce .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Sometimes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The incidence of type 1 ( T1 ) diabetes in young children age 6 is on the rise and the management demands of these youngsters are **unique** due to their physiological and developmental characteristics .*  

- *Hypoxia is **very unique** in that it has developed a means of modulating gene expression by regulating the post - translational stabilization of a protein .* (also amplified)

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *In particular we have combined in what we believe to be a relatively **unique** set of studies , a phage display library to define non- overlapping epitopes of 1CA512 with in vitro transcription and translation of identified epitope fragments , to develop epitope fragment specific radioassays for anti-islet autoantibodies .*  

- *The hypothesis that these agents increase intracellular K + levels by a possibly **unique** mechanism , via inhibition of an ouabain - insensitive furosemide - sensitive Na+K + C1 - cotransport system , will be tested in several cell lines in culture , including BALB / c 3 T3 preadipose cells , normal human fibroblasts , and HL - 60 human leukemic cells .*
