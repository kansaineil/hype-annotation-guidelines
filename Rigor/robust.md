### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- **Not a value-judgement** when describing measurable or mechanistic properties of biological systems, responses, or effects.  
  Typical non-value uses: *robust response; robust activation; robust resistance; robust expression; robust effect(s); robust growth / tolerance*.  
- **Value-judgement** when evaluating the quality, reliability, or desirability of research, tools, infrastructure, or abstract processes .

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *However, it is often difficult to induce and maintain **robust** tolerance that is resistant to external perturbations.* (NOT value-judgement)

- *This should allow a **robust** analysis as to whether cigarettes behave as an inferior good and the effect this status has on consumption by the mentioned groups.* (value-judgement)

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when applied to abstract, institutional, or methodological nouns where robustness is not operationalized.  
Common nouns include:  
*research; method(s); model(s); approach; framework; way; manner; infrastructure; platform; pipeline; program; training; tools; software; technology; database; community; collaboration; mentoring; recruitment; understanding; foundation; strategy; process.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Recent advances in Next-Gen sequencing technology, along with the development of **robust** analysis methods, have given researchers the ability to identify sequence variants.* (gratuitous)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g., *the most, very, highly, particularly, extremely, remarkably, extraordinarily, exceptionally, uniquely, doubly, surprisingly, amazingly, incredibly, truly, especially, increasingly, quite, so, scientifically, unusually*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It was found that the original 1D simulation software was very **robust** in this regard.*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked with other positive descriptors (e.g., *reliable, efficient, novel, simple, accurate, sensitive, effective, flexible, unique, powerful, comprehensive, new, innovative, versatile, scalable, practical, safe, stable, selective, reproducible, consistent, precise, broad, relevant, promising, strong*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The major strengths of the approach we propose are the novel and **robust** microarray technology and advanced bioinformatics / mathematical analyses we have developed and employed.*

</details>

---

### **3d. Grounds**  
Rarely justified by evidence.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

NA

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Often framed in relative terms (e.g., *more robust*).  
Usually not hedged.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *There is also an unfilled need to develop surrogate markers and more **robust** and simpler screening instruments for HAND, to allow for earlier detection, for tracking of the course of HAND, and improving the efficiency of clinical trials.*
