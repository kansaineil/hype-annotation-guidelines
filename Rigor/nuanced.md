### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes. Typically evaluates subtlety or sophistication (similar to *detailed*).  
Not a value-judgement when describing intrinsic system behaviour or fine-grained variation (often in neuroscience, motor control, perception).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Therefore , this equipment will significantly enhance our understanding of the **nuanced** relationships between thermodynamics , structure , and function , and expedite development and design of more potent and specific drugs for a wide variety of diseases including microbial infections , autism , and schizophrenia .*

- *Mice rely on their whiskers to investigate the world around them ; their whisker system uses specialized motor circuits to generate **nuanced** and complex whisker motions in order to make fine discriminations about objects in their environment .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Usually gratuitous, especially with abstract nouns (e.g. *understanding, picture, view, perspective, role, information, way, assessment, study, approach, framework, data, description, analysis, interpretation, investigation, relationships, strategies*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *To allow a more **nuanced** understanding of CU , and to ensure scientific rigor , our assessments will include self - and parent-reports and a behavioral game to address our three aims : ( 1 ) Investigate the developmental significance of early CU and related behaviors on later adolescent CU and socio-emotional behaviors ( e.g. , does early CU predict later outcomes ?*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Rarely amplified (e.g. *highly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Project V studies will produce highly **nuanced** , quantifiable and independent key dimensions of the unique social behavior characteristic of WS .*

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked, especially with other rigour adjectives (e.g. *complex and nuanced, detailed and nuanced, rich and nuanced, sophisticated and nuanced*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This large , diverse , well - characterized multi-site cohort captures longitudinal clinical data , patient reported outcomes such as physical activity , depression , and substance use , and also bio-specimens , facilitating a **nuanced** and detailed approach to addressing risk .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Rarely justified by evidence.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Often framed in relative terms (e.g. *more nuanced analysis*).  
Usually not hedged.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Understanding the role of social networks in highly mobile bridging populations is critical to a more **nuanced** and contextualized understanding of infectious disease transmission in border regions .*
