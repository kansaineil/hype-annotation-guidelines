### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- **NOT value-judgement** when modifying nouns that denote recognized research procedures, study designs, or error types (e.g., *systematic review, systematic investigation, systematic analysis, systematic synthesis, systematic errors, systematic bias*).
- **Value-judgement** when modifying abstract process nouns where the contrast with *unsystematic* is implicit rather than explicit (adds virtue rather than content).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *A **systematic** review of randomized trials was conducted following PRISMA guidelines.* (NOT HYPE)

- *Systematic errors can arise from calibration drift in the measurement apparatus.* (NOT HYPE)

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when applied to nouns where systematicity is inherent or no alternative is specified, e.g.:  
*framework, evaluation, approach, way, manner, fashion, effort(s), program, application, attempt, plan, strategy, understanding, information*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The aim is to develop a **systematic** framework for the choice of the R group, which confers a desired set of properties on the resulting polymer …*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Occasionally amplified (e.g., *highly, most, very, increasingly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Moreover, we propose to determine, in a highly **systematic** manner, whether the availability of specific brain proteins, the acute brain activational effects of cocaine, or the integrity of functional brain networks predicts cocaine abuse and relapse.*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked with other rigour or evaluation adjectives (e.g., *comprehensive, rigorous, detailed, careful, efficient, rational, thorough, rapid, extensive, unbiased, reliable, novel, quantitative, innovative, reproducible, robust, scientific*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These studies emphasize the need for a **systematic** and comprehensive understanding of the role of the Auger effects in Radiation Biology.*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Rarely justified by evidence.

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Sometimes framed in relative terms (e.g., *more systematic*, *lack of systematic X*).  
Rarely hedged.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These experiments will provide a laboratory model that will allow for a more **systematic** and efficient observation of factors associated with relapse and the manipulation of variables that may be effective in treatment.*
