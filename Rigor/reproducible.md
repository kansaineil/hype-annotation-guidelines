### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- NOT a value-judgement when describing a measurable property of a (biomedical) system or response.  
- Value-judgement when evaluating methods, tools, models, or research outputs.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *To operate as a photon counter, the rod must generate **reproducible** responses to each photon absorbed.* (NOT value-judgement)

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

NA

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when grounds are not given (i.e., no operationalization or evidence; no “because …”; no stated procedure or criteria for reproducibility).  
Also often gratuitous with abstract or process nouns (e.g., *reproducible manner / way / fashion*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This project will develop and validate a fast , sensitive , and **reproducible** method for direct analysis of perchlorate and iodide in human body fluids by isotachophoresis- zone electrophoresis on chip .* (gratuitous)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g., *highly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We developed a highly **reproducible** assay for …*

</details>

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often coordinated or stacked with other rigour or performance adjectives (e.g., *accurate, sensitive, objective, easy to use*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…a lack of accurate, **reproducible**, and easy to use cell culture models …*

- *…a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and **reproducible** measures of disease severity and progression.*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Occasionally grounded when explicit procedures, standards, or validation criteria are given; otherwise uncommon.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Appears in negated or gap-marking contexts that reduce promotional force.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Because of this reimplementation and a lack of open standards, much of the published literature on medical image reconstruction is not **reproducible**.*
