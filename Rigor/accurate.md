## Accurate — annotation guidance summary

| Criteria | Typical behaviour / interpretation | Example (Not hype) | Example (Hype) |
|---------:|----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **1. Value-judgement** | Usually evaluative - implies correctness / reliability | _(to add)_ | _(to add)_ |
| **2. Hyperbolic** | Not inherently hyperbolic | — | — |
| **3a. Gratuitous** | Depends on noun: check whether meaning changes if *accurate* is removed | *accurate measurement* → meaning changes | *accurate diagnosis* → meaning unchanged |
| **3a-i. Noun type cue** | Use noun semantics to decide: see table below | — | — |
| **3b. Amplified** | Often boosted by intensifiers or stance verbs | _(to add: justified comparative)_ | *highly accurate*, *demonstrated accurate* |
| **3c. Broader context** | Often stacked with other promotional adjectives | _(to add)_ | *robust and accurate methods* |
| **3d. Grounds** | Evidence/justification commonly provided → safer | *accuracy validated using datasets* | _(to add: no justification)_ |
| **3e. Relative / Hedged** | Often refered to in relative terms | *more accurate than existing tools* | _(to add: absolute assertion)_ |

### Noun type heuristic (supports Criterion 3a)

| Noun category | Examples | Interpretation | Implication for *accurate* |
|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Degree-variable** | prediction, measurement, estimation, modelling | Accuracy varies by degree | Usually **not** gratuitous |
| **Outcome-entailing** | diagnosis, detection, segregation, transcription | Correctness presupposed | Often **gratuitous** |
| **Borderline** | assessment, definition, information, data | Depends on context | Check other criteria |
