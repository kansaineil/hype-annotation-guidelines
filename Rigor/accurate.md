## Accurate — annotation guidance summary

| Criteria | Typical behaviour / interpretation |
|---------:|----------------------------------|
| 1. Value-judgement | Almost always evaluative (implies correctness / reliability) |
| 2. Hyperbolic | Not inherently extreme; rarely hyperbolic |
| 3a. Gratuitous | Dependent on noun semantics (see below) |
| 3b. Amplified | Frequently amplified by modifiers or stance verbs |
| 3c. Broader context | Frequently appears in stacked adjective phrases |
| 3d. Grounds | Often justified with evidence (reduces promotionality) |
| 3e. Relative / Hedged | Comparatives reduce promotionality |

---

### 1. Value-judgement

Almost always evaluative (implies correctness / reliability).

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (context expresses limitation or neutral state) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (promotes credibility without detail) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 2. Hyperbolic

Not inherently extreme; hyperbole arises only when combined with boosters.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (if exaggerated claim is present) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3a. Gratuitous

Check whether the noun already presupposes correctness.

Noun semantic categories:

| Noun category | Example nouns | Implication |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Degree-variable | measurement, prediction, estimation | Usually necessary → Not hype |
| Outcome-entailing | diagnosis, detection, replication | Often gratuitous → Potential hype |
| Borderline | assessment, data, information | Decide using other criteria |

Examples:

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (meaning changes if removed) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (meaning unchanged if removed) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3b. Amplified

Often intensified with adverbs or assertive stance verbs.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (supported by evidence) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (unqualified boosting) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3c. Broader context

Stacking with other evaluative terms increases promotional force.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (no stacking) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (appears in hype cluster) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3d. Grounds

Justification reduces promotionality.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (explicit evidence or testing described) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (unsupported claim) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3e. Relative / Hedged

Comparatives and uncertainty markers reduce hype interpretation.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (comparative / hedged) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (absolute claim) | _(to add)_ |

---

### Summary instruction

Annotate *accurate* as **hype** only when:
- It does **not** add new information (especially with outcome-entailing nouns), or
- It is **amplified** or **stacked** without justification

Otherwise → **not hype**

### Annotated examples for *accurate*

#### Not hype

| Full sentence (as provided) | Interpretation (linked to criteria) |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| The lack of **accurate** dosimetric measurements causes uncertainty in exposure assessment … | Limitation framing; accuracy required for meaning → 3e Relative + Not gratuitous (3a) |
| Our goal is to provide a more **accurate** picture of the significantly populated conformations … | Comparative improvement → 3e Relative / Hedged |
| The petrosal sinus sampling examination is the single most **accurate** test both for | Diagnostic performance grounded in measurement → 3d Grounds |
| Long-term objectives will include a more **accurate** determination of the number of genes | Comparative framing → 3e Relative |
| It is **accurate** to within a few percent and has a relative precision of | Empirical precision stated → 3d Grounds |
| The device was equally **accurate** regardless of years of experience or level of training . | Comparative → 3e Relative |
| Tissue changes during surgery render the preoperative scans less and less **accurate** as the surgery progresses . | Negative deterioration → 3e Relative |

#### Hype

| Full sentence (as provided) | Interpretation (linked to criteria) |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Our goal of the proposed research is to develop a highly **accurate** and reproducible method to assess the severity of | Amplified (3b) + Stacked (3c) + promotional future claim |
| Our goal is to develop a methodology for **accurate** diagnosis of the fertility of human semen | Outcome noun presupposes correctness → Gratuitous (3a) + forward-promotional |
| By tagging areas on the 3D image , **accurate** determination of changes in important criteria such as anatomic | Outcome noun presupposes correctness + stacked with important → 3a + 3c |
| Provide **accurate** , timely , comprehensive , and standardized postmortem examinations (co-ordinated) | Strong stacking cluster → 3c Broader context (Hype unless strong justification follows) |
