### **1. Value-judgement**  
Often yes. Commonly signals sophistication, superiority, or progress (≈ *state-of-the-art, high-level*).  
Not a value-judgement when part of a fixed acronym or name (*Advanced Placement, Advanced Encryption Standard*), or when used in a technical sense meaning late-stage or progressed (*advanced cancer, advanced disease*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These efforts have resulted in an **advanced** information management system at BCM and an Integrated Library System at the TMCL .*

- *These will include traditional combination chemotherapy trials in **advanced** cancer , studies of chemotherapy prior to the use of surgery and / or radiation therapy in patients with known poor prognosis , and development of drug combinations through laboratory and clinical investigation into rational sequencing of antimetabolites .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Typically gratuitous when presented in absolute terms with nouns that denote expertise, method, or technical capacity, e.g.:  
*training, imaging, research, method, technology, technique, data, microscopy, skill, development, statistics, biostatistics, practice, knowledge, understanding, instrumentation, analysis, tool, study, computing, modeling, approach, topic, sequencing, algorithm, software, feature, capability, methodology, information*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The core of the **advanced** training program consists of i ) modular learning at the partner institutions , ii ) practical work with ethics review committees , iii ) attendance of an intensive bioethics program through the Bioethics Institute , and iv ) the completion of a dissertation / research paper on a topic of relevance to strengthening health research ethics at the trainee 's home institution .*

- *These **advanced** research students will have a 2 - year intensive research experience in the lab of a biomedical researcher , academic support , summer research externships , and seminar courses in oral and written presentation of research and responsible conduct of research .*

- *Our studies will greatly contribute to our understanding of the molecular virulence mechanisms of this pathogen and significantly move the field forward by the application of newly developed genetic tools and **advanced** technology .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Often amplified: *the most, greatly, highly, very, extremely, increasingly, well, far, quite, particularly, fundamentally*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The experimental studies will be **highly accurate** X-ray and neutron diffraction analysis of about ten selected phosphate crystal structures .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked: e.g. *novel, innovative, unique, cutting-edge (implicit), large (when evaluative), current (when evaluative), emerging, invaluable*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *First , we will support the development and application of **advanced** and innovative statistical methodologies ( e.g. , supervised and unsupervised machine learning , outcome - weighted learning , Markov state modeling , high dimensional low sample size methods , heterogeneity of treatment effects ) to clinical RMD studies ; this will include support for our Phenotyping and Precision Medicine Core .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Often framed in relative terms: *more advanced*  
Rarely not hedged
