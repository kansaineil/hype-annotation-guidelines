### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes. Often evaluates complexity, advancement, or refinement.  
Non–value judgement when it refers to intrinsic mechanistic complexity of a biological or physical system or process, where complexity is an inherent property rather than a claim of quality.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Using such an advanced and **sophisticated** device currently available in the market (Diasonics, DRF-400), the user groups will image central and peripheral vessels of their study population, measure blood vessel diameter and cross sectional area, calculate average flow volume and velocity profiles, and thus derive additional insights into the pathophysiological processes.*

- *Daphnia are simple enough to permit the detailed quantitative studies needed for answering these questions, yet complex enough to have **sophisticated** optomotor behaviors.*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous with: *understanding, knowledge, information, data, research, study, analysis, approach, model, measure, measures, methodology, strategy, insight, level, state, set.*  
Sometimes gratuitous with: *tool, technique, method, methods, technology, technologies, instrumentation, instrument, equipment, software, algorithm, platform.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This will serve as a foundation for a **sophisticated** understanding of the pathophysiology of human growth and development, and may lead in turn to the design of new means of medical intervention.*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g., *highly, increasingly, the most, very, extremely, clinically, remarkably, clearly, extraordinarily, surprisingly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The Mouse Genetics and Gene Modification (MGGM) Section at CMB/NIAID provides highly **sophisticated** CRISPR Cas9 mediated genome editing in embryos and in cells as well as related services such as: a) cryopreservation of sperm; b) cryopreservation of embryo for long term storage of valuable mouse lines; and c) rederivation of lines from cryopreserved embryos and sperm.*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked (e.g., *comprehensive, innovative, systematic, novel, new, extensive, relevant, detailed, careful, sophisticated, timely, unique, creative, efficient, broad, critical, rich, thorough, appropriate, simultaneous, large, precise, robust, safe, vibrant, clear, deep, definitive, diverse, cohesive, complete, effective, exciting*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Building on our record in previous community-based trials, we expect that trial results will be timely, rigorous, and directly relevant to public health guidelines and will immediately influence fall prevention policies related to vitamin D supplementation in older persons.*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Rarely justified by evidence.

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Sometimes framed in relative terms (e.g., *more sophisticated*).  
Sometimes hedged (e.g., *less, relatively, sufficiently, adequately, appropriately, rather, quite, equally, as sophisticated as, not, somewhat, moderately*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Thus, we must use more **sophisticated** approaches to analyze direct interactions between the steroid receptors and associated cochaperones.*
