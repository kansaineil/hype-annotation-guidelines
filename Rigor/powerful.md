### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes. Typically expresses strength or impact.  
Not a value-judgement in a few technical phrases (e.g. *statistical power*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *A **powerful** combination of physical and chemical techniques , such as NMR and EPR , will be employed to address these questions , and these will be extended by the preparation and characterization of highly specific chemical agents , monoclonal antibodies , to label and identify the portion of the protein which is involved in its many functions .*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *To attain these objectives we use two **powerful** experimental techniques : intracochlear pressure measurements and interferometric measurements of intracochlear and middle ear motion .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g. *the most, very, extremely, highly, uniquely, particularly, increasingly, remarkably, exceptionally*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked, especially with novelty adjectives (e.g. *unique and powerful, novel and powerful, new and powerful, innovative and powerful, effective and powerful, versatile and powerful, powerful and reliable*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The goal of this proposal is to develop a commercial plug and play , user -friendly , **powerful** and reliable dynamic clamp system , to enable all neuronal electrophysiologists to be able to perform sophisticated dynamic clamp experiments , without any requirement for programming , engineering , or mathematical modeling skills .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Rarely justified by evidence.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These results suggest that morphometrical analysis may provide a more **powerful** tool to investigate problems of genetic risk than was previously believed .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Often framed in relative terms (e.g. *more powerful*).  
Usually not hedged.
