### **1. Value-judgement**  
- **Yes** when meaning *superior*.  
- **Yes** (albeit weak) when meaning *remaining / unresolved* (framing a gap as salient / important; cf. *unmet*, *unanswered*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The Core Grant is largely responsible for the overall success of our scientific programs and has been crucial to our ability to recruit an **outstanding** research team of physicians and basic scientists.*

- *Thus, answers can now be obtained to several **outstanding** questions about the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, the correlation of kinetic characteristics with the structure and function, and the involvement of the tertiary and quaternary structures in activity.*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Yes when meaning *superior*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Our background in medical imaging innovation, coupled with our **outstanding** record of training scientists over the last three decades, makes Stanford ideally positioned to become the West Coast Resource Center for advanced magnetic resonance technology.*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often, yes.

- Commonly modifies entities / groups associated with research (e.g. *environment, scientists, faculty, team, resources, students, mentors, program, facilities*), adding positive evaluation.
- Also common with achievement or performance nouns (e.g. *record, success, progress, quality, expertise, contributions, potential, opportunity*), where it intensifies approval.
- In “remaining / unresolved” uses (*outstanding questions / issues / problems*), it primarily adds salience or emphasis, similar to *unanswered* or *unmet*.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This group of proteins presents an **outstanding** opportunity for understanding regulatory interactions of the proteins with each other and with DNA.*

- *Results obtained from these investigations will resolve the **outstanding** questions concerning the number of enzymes involved in vitamin K and vitamin KO metabolism, the nature of their catalytically active groups, and the factors regulating their inhibition by warfarin.*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Possible (e.g. *truly, already, consistently*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *If funded, this cancer nanotechnology program will be housed in the Winship Cancer Institute, a new 280,000 sq ft cancer research and care building located on the Emory Campus and with a truly **outstanding** environment for collaborative and translational cancer research.*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Common.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This planning grant will facilitate interactions between investigators in these **outstanding** programs and it will provide a unique opportunity to expand research efforts related to breast cancer in older women.*
