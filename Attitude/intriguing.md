### **1. Value-judgement**  
Yes, usually.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This study examines the contributions of an **intriguing** family of novel proteins, the Lrigs, to inner ear development.*

</details>

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
No. Not inherently hyperbolic.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

NA

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous in attributive use, especially with abstract or epistemic nouns that already encode informational content. Common head nouns include:  
*possibility, hypothesis, finding(s), question(s), result(s), observation(s), evidence, data, model, aspect(s), idea, problem, insight(s), role, property, relationship, pattern, phenomenon, implication(s), difference(s), mechanism, target(s).*  

Ask whether *intriguing* can be deleted without changing the propositional content.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This pattern raises the **intriguing** possibility of a common evolutionary mechanism, but its genetic basis remains mostly uncharacterized.*

- *These factors are particularly **intriguing** because they are required primarily or specifically in the recipient organism, may be encoded by the donor cell chromosome rather than the virulence factors, and are required in a species-specific manner.* (non-gratuitous)

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g. *particularly, very, highly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Some very **intriguing** results and observations from experiments concerning the organization of the olivocerebellar projection in mutant mice (see Progress Report) have led to the experiments in this continuation.*

</details>

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often in promotional research framing.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *By combining these techniques, the proposed study will generate significant new information on the important and **intriguing** question of why whites are more susceptible to osteoporosis than blacks and, in addition, will provide valuable information on how representative the standard iliac biopsy site is of the axial skeleton both in terms of static histomorphometric measures and mechanical strength.*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Weakly electric fish are **intriguing** because the frequency sensitivity of the sensory receptors and the frequency output of the emitter, the electric organ, are not only well matched but both effector and receptor pathways show hormone-mediated plasticity.*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Rare.
