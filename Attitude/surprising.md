### **1. Value-judgement**  
Yes – almost always.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We have made the rather **surprising** discovery that a single lipid-linked oligosaccharide serves as the general precursor of all asparagine-linked glycopeptides.*

</details>

---

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
No.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

NA

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Usually yes in attributive constructions.  
Common head nouns include: *finding(s), discovery(ies), observation(s), result(s), degree, role(s), ability, lack, number, conclusion, feature(s), difference(s), diversity, evidence, similarity(ies), insight(s), level, paucity, range, effect(s), fact, aspect(s), capacity, complexity, data, outcome, phenomenon.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These **surprising** findings led to the realization that AbpA inhibits sucrose-dependent colonization determinants such as, but perhaps not limited to, GtfG of S. gordonii.*

</details>

---

### **3b. Amplified**  
Often yes – e.g. *particularly, extremely, especially, entirely, very*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *One of the very **surprising** findings from statewide studies is that less than half of high school science teachers have an undergraduate degree in science.*

</details>

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *A novel and **surprising** finding of this study was that the addition of rhodopsin to the PE-containing bilayers produced more disordered acyl chain packing, and this effect increased with increasing mol % PE.*

</details>

---

### **3d. Grounds**  
Possible.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This was **surprising** because physical activity is mechanistically linked, in part, to anabolic function through the growth hormone (GH) → IGF-I axis, and fitter adolescents and adults tend to have higher levels of IGF-I.*

</details>

---

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Possible – e.g. *somewhat*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Therefore, it is somewhat **surprising** that these reagents do not have a higher therapeutic index in vivo.*
