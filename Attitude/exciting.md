### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Yes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These studies offer the **exciting** prospect of yielding high resolution structural information of a lipid-requiring membrane enzyme .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Almost always. Can usually be deleted without changing propositional meaning.  

Common head nouns: *finding(s), result(s), data, discovery, opportunity, possibility, potential, research, approach, progress, advance, development, field, project*.

Possible exceptions when used as a predicate.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This builds on **exciting** recent work that suggests that some of the key determinants of smoking progression include community contexts.* (gratuitous)

- *This is **exciting** because a small peptide provides higher potency and targeting than a small molecule while maintaining a smaller size and decreasing toxicity and accumulation potential than the whole protein, and so can be used repeatedly in the same individual.* (non-gratuitous)
